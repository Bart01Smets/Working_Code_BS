# EPI-ECON Modeling Project

This repository contains deterministic and stochastic simulations for epidemic-economic modeling based on the SIRD framework, inspired by Farboodi et al. (2020).

## Features

- Deterministic and stochastic SIR simulations
- Behavioral policy modeling (optimal vs. laissez-faire)
- Economic cost tracking (health, activity, total)
- Binomial transitions and stochastic beta realizations
- Validation against reference `.rds` files

## Getting Started

1. Open `workbench XX.R` in RStudio
2. Make sure `epi_econ_lib_13.R` is sourced
3. Run the deterministic model:
```r
output <- run_sir_binomial(initial_state, times, parameters, ...)
